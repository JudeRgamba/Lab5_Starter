1. I would not use unit testing to test the "message" feature for sending messages between users. This is too complex for unit testing, as it involves multiple users and servers at the feature level. 
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This feature can easily be tested and debugged without affecting non-related tests or features because it involves straightfoward and simple logic.
